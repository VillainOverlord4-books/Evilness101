   This website has been created with blood, sweat and tears. It has been an arduous journey, with the support of so many, the thanks infinite.
 Peak & Seek was established by a student of IGS in 2025. Her mission was to create a website that could intrigue teachers and students alike. It has grown since then to a full-fledged travel guide for those clients who seek to go on adventures to find hidden gems. We are dedicated to find those little-known master pieces of the world and deliver them to you. We hope that this website is everything you wished for and more.<br>
